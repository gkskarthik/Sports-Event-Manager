Project description.
1.All the codes where imported to eclipse.
2.Induvidual classes are created for all testing the methods.
3.All the test cases for each of the methods which are to be tested are put under induvidual classes for the respective methods.
4.This is done by creating a Junit class.
5.The test cases are distinguished from the normal methods by using an annotation named @Test above the respective test cases.

Cpmpiling and Execution:

1.There are induvidual Junit classes created for each of the method to be tested.
2.To compile all the test cases at once, we have created a test suite.
3.All the Junit classes are imported into the test suite.
4.If we run the test suite,which is by the name AllTest in our project,all the test cases will run automatically and we can easily test whether each of te test case produces success,failure or error.
5.We can also get the entire code coverage by using eclemma which is downloaded from the eclipse market place.
6.This is how the project is run.
